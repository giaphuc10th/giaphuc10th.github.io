# giaphuc10th.github.io
My name is Nguyen Hoang Gia Phuc. I'm a first-year student of the University of Information and Technology. My major is Computer Science. I create this github to share my experience of my learning path with other people. Moreover, this github is the note that I write my learned knowledge. I hope that everyone can help me improve my shortcomming.
